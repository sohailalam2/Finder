# Keyword Finder Project

The Keyword Finder is a simple application written in Java that helps you
quickly and efficiently search for keywords/phrase in a file,
directory or even crawling through nested directories.

It is an ongoing project. Please feel free to contribute to this Project and make it even better.

## How to build

You require the following to build the Keyword Finder:

* Latest stable [Oracle JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/)
* Latest stable [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)

Note that this is build-time requirement.  JDK 6 is enough to run your Keyword Finder based application.
