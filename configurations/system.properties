ENABLE_DEEP_SEARCH=true
#
## If enabled, the Keyword Finder will keep on searching for the keyword/phrase
## until it hits the end of file (EOF) and hence will report the number of times
## it encountered the keyword in that particular file.
## When disabled, it will only look for the existence of the keyword/phrase
## and will stop searching the file when it has found a match.
## This will significantly improve the performance.
## This behaviour however does not stop the Finder to search for the same keyword in
## other files, if it is doing a directory based search.
## Possible Values: true / false
ENABLE_STATISTICS=true
#
## The duration in seconds after which the statistics will be shown on screen
STATISTICS_UPDATE_PERIOD=10
#
## If enabled (by setting to true), then the WHAT_TO_SEARCH configuration
## parameter may contain Regular Expression (RegEx) Pattern
## Possible Values: true / false
ENABLE_PATTERN_SEARCH=false
#
## If using RegEx Pattern, then additional settings can be done
## using this configuration.
## Match flags, a bit mask that may include
## {1 => UNIX_LINES}, {2 => CASE_INSENSITIVE}, {4 => COMMENTS}, {8 => MULTILINE},
## {16 => LITERAL}, {32 => DOTALL}, {64 => UNICODE_CASE} and {128 => CANON_EQ}
## Possible Values: 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 / 64 / 128
PATTERN_MATCH_FLAG=2
#
## The keyword or phrase to search for.
## NOTE: The phrase can be space separated but must be properly escaped and must not
## contain an equal-to (=) sign
## If you need to search for the (=) sign too, then please use the command line
## option to enter your phrase.
## Command Line Usage (notice the double quotes):
## Finder "<some keyword>" "<path to search>"
WHAT_TO_SEARCH=Sohail Alam
#
## The path where to begin the search. This can be a single file or a directory
## If you need to search all nested directories then be sure to enable deep search.
PATH_TO_SEARCH=d:/
#
## If enabled, then you can filter your search based on the file type provided
## in the next configuration parameter
ENABLE_FILE_FILTER=false
#
## Filter: The file type to search for. It can be a comma separated values
## It is recommended that you use file type which can be read in as characters
FILTER_FILE_TYPE=txt, log
